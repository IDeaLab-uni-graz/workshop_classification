Welcome to the Introductory Workshop on Machine Learning and Classification!
===
This workshop is designed for 6th-grade school students to introduce them to the basics of machine learning and classification using Python.
In this workshop, you will learn:
- What is machine learning?
- What are the core concepts used in machine learning?
- How to use Python to implement a simple machine learning model for classification.

## Prerequisites
Since this workshop is designed for 6th-grade students, no prior knowledge of machine learning or programming is required.
Indeed, even though this workshop is written in Jupyter notebooks, the code is meant to be a ready-to-run tool for students
to visualize concepts and learn the basics of machine learning.

From a mathematical point of view, students should have a basic understanding of:
- Functions such as linear functions, logarithms, and exponentials.
- Simple statistics and probability concepts in order to understand a simple experiment such as tossing a coin (at least intuitively).

In particular, even though the notebooks also discuss tangents, derivatives are not required to understand the concepts presented in this workshop.

## Workshop Structure
The workshop is structured into several Jupyter notebooks, each covering a specific topic related to machine learning and classification. The notebooks are designed to be interactive, allowing students to run code and visualize results.
The notebooks are organized as follows:
1. `introduction.ipynb`: An introduction to machine learning and classification with some examples showcasing the power of machine learning.
2. `basics.ipynb`: A brief overview of the core concepts used in machine learning. The notebook covers the following topics:
   - What is a model?
   - How to *learn* a model?
   - What is a loss function?
   - Intuition behind gradient descent.
   - What is a neural network?
3. `cats_and_dogs.ipynb`: A simple classification task using a dataset of images of cats and dogs. The notebook covers the following topics:
   - Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
   - Training a simple neural network model.
   - Evaluating the model's performance.
   - Visualizing the results.
